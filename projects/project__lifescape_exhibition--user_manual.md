# Project **lifescape()** Exhibition
## Participation Manual

> **Version:** 0.1.0 (Draft Contract)

---
**Lead Maintainer's Note:** This document serves as the open user manual and living documentation for the `lifescape()` community exhibition. It is a `'contract'` in its draft sense and stage, an invitation to a collaborative praxis. It is an artifact of André's  `README` project, and some of its principles are derived from there.

```yaml
contract:
  intent: "draft exhibition"     # primary key
  scope: this        # bounded context
  outputs: ["markdown","diff"]
  validation: ["falsifiability_probe","AndYet_counterread"]
```

## §1. Title Proposal

We will call the exhibition ***‘lifescape()’***.

The title syntax is intentional. In programming, the `()` suggests a function call, a dynamic process, an event being executed. It frames the exhibition not as a static collection of objects, but as a living, breathing `Machine` of sorts. Call it something, put something in, get something out -- basically.

## §2. Rationale

Life drawing sessions are as much **shelter** as they are **dance**.

Some of us are dancers, some are architects, and some are programmers, and all other kinds of --ers. This title is an invitation to all. It acknowledges that drawing is a dynamic, magical act — sometimes more, sometimes less.

The **architects** in our group might show something of structure, planning, and process. **And yet,** the power is in the final, living line on the page. The **dancers** can show something of the body, of the language of being.

And then there are the rest of us: students, facilitators, workers, and people being people. What we all do, what unites us, is the act of engaging as a **body in a lifescape.** This exhibition is a record of that engagement. It is a collection of observations, mistakes, and successes at play, at work, at practice. Lots of practice. It is a testament to the brutally beautiful striving."

## §3. Invitation

Share in the sense of engagement encountered and reflected by a few of us who practice through ‘Lifedrawing Randburg’, in Randburg, Greater Johannesburg, South Africa.

## §4. Curation & The `Socio-Anarco` Principle

This will be a **co-curated** exhibition. A non-domination oriented, community-driven process. The curation team is the set of `Contributors`/  `Observers` who will act as stewards for the collective.

**Partisipating Artists / Co-curators:** André Clements, Annette Wietzorrek, Loreal Vos, Kevin Richard John Berry, Sadé Sandham and other participants.

## §5. The Praxis & The Invitation to Collaborate

The `praxis` of this exhibition is as important as the final artifacts.

-   **The Catalogue:** We will produce a catalogue with curatorial information and prose, to contextualize the practice of life drawing in a wider, more philosophical landscape.
-   **The `Network`:** From this point on, all collaboration will be invited into a separate, dedicated space for those who have submitted work. This creates a new, trusted `Network` for the project.
-   **The `Axiom of Maculate Design`:** We will welcome all levels of skill and finish. This is not a project in search of "immaculate" objects, but an honest reflection of a living `praxis`.
-   **The `Unromantic Conclusion`:** We will "actively dance the striving, regardless of how near or far the mythical good might be for us."

Our final, guiding principle is this:
> **‘If you feel drawn, you are welcome.’**
