## This Painter's Protocol (for cleanish brushes)
> A Circuit Breaker for Sane Engagement  
> **Version:** 2.0 (Stable Release)

---

### §0. BOOTLOADER (module)

**Lead Maintainer's Note:** This document replaces a colder, more technical "benchmark" with an embodied maintenance ritual. It is a protocol for intellectual and creative hygiene. The goal is not to achieve an immaculate state, but to do the necessary, unromantic work of keeping the tools "cleanish" so that the next act of creation remains as viable as possible. This protocol applies to all engagements with entities of and with intent, organic, synthetic or otherwise.

- **Invariant:** `chop wood, carry water, clean brushes.`
- **Heuristic:** `Signal > Noise. Maintain headroom.`
- **Stance:** `Tools > Takes. Evidence over labels. Attention is finite.`

### §1. The Tools (The Solvents & The Rags)

*Every engagement leaves a residue. The `Operator` must clean after an interaction.*

- **`Falsifiability` (The Primary Solvent / `DBC: testability gate`)**  
  Can a precise, falsifiable question, in principle, prove the claim wrong? If not, the "paint" (medium and properties) is dirt, not a color.

- **`The And Yet Protocol` (The Counterpoint Rinse / `method: deliberate opposing read`)**  
  The system’s core dialectical engine. It forces consideration of the counter-argument, the complication, and the shadow of any single, coherent claim.

- **`The Empty Turn` (The Rag / `sovereign exit`)**  
  The `Operator`’s non-negotiable right to end the cleaning process and declare the brush “cleanish enough” when returns on engagement go negative.

---

### §2. Contamination Classes (The State of the Pigment)

*A starter taxonomy for identifying non-useful “pigments” or bad-faith arguments.*

- **`C1: The Wrong Color`** → `F1: Factual Error`
- **`C2: The Missed Stroke`** → `F2: Instruction Miss`
- **`C3: The Muddy Mix`** → `F3: Conflation` (Capabilities / Harms / Hype)
- **`C4: The Dried Gunk`** → `F4: Refusal` (unfalsifiable claims)
- **`C5: The Smear`** → `F5: Ad Hominem / Slur`

---

### §3. The Protocol in Play (The Act of Cleaning)

*Core operational logic (pseudocode).*

```pseudo
// Preconditions: Design-by-Contract ensures a baseline of good faith.
require noSlur(claim)                 // high-pass filter for F5/C5 contamination
require claimsAreLayered(claim)       // integrity check for F3/C3 conflation

play operatorLoop():
  // foundational maintenance ritual; maintenance > mystique
  for task in ["chop wood","carry water","clean brushes"]:
    do(task)

play engageWithPigment(observer, claim):
  // §1. Apply the primary solvents to the incoming pigment.
  q := makeFalsifiableQuestion(claim)    // Solvent 1: Falsifiability
  ask(q)
  applyAndYet(claim)                     // Solvent 2: The And Yet Protocol

  // §2. Open a soft gate to limit bad-faith resource drain.
  exchanges := 0
  timer := startTimer(10m)

  while exchanges < 2 && timer.isActive():
    if answerIsEvidence(q):
      return setState(observer, ReciprocalCritic)   // brush is clean
    exchanges++

  // §3. If the gate closes without resolution, trip the circuit breaker.
  return beginWashout(observer)

play beginWashout(observer):
  // contaminated brush set aside; circuit breaker trip
  setState(observer, NonReciprocalCritic)
  mute(observer, 90d)
  log(level="notice", msg="Pigment failed falsifiability test; contaminated.", id=observer.id)
  return NonReciprocalCritic

play reAdmit(observer):
  // allow a cleaned brush back into the set
  if observer.retractsFalseClaim() || observer.acceptsControlledTest():
    unmute(observer)
    return setState(observer, ReciprocalCritic)
````

## §4. A Note on Controlled Tests (The Editor’s Lab)

The `reAdmit` function may require a formal **Controlled Test**. This is a maximalist, ideal standard for testing the capability claims of a complex, non-human `Machine` (like a CI). Its principles (demand for evidence) apply universally; its specific implementation is specialized. Use `discretion` when applying this level of rigor to human `Observers`.

* **CQS (Command/Query Separation):** Build commands (`publish`, `mute`) do not wait on measurement queries (`probes`). Praxis proceeds; measurement is optional but, when done, must be controlled.

* **Formal definitions:** Parameters for a valid controlled test.

```pseudo
struct Controls { temperature, toolsOff, modelId, modelDate, nTrials }

predicate critiqueGate(c: Controls) :=
  c.toolsOff && c.temperature == 0 && c.nTrials >= 50

policy AnecdoteWeight := ε unless critiqueGate(controls)
```

*(For a fuller spec, see §7.)*

## §5. Operator Hygiene (Personal Praxis)

* No public motive-diagnostics. Log tersely and privately.
* Maintain SNR: focus on data, not drama.
* Avoid clip-replies: leave emotional and intellectual headroom.
* Default mute window: days to forever; review only on a clear re-admit signal.

---

## §6. Publishing & Anonymisation

Abstract observer identity; interpret gesture; preserve signal integrity.

```pseudo
play PublishTag():
  return hash("Observer", utcDate(), nonce)   // e.g., Observer#2025-08-09-01
```

No names, no motives. Tags, dates, facts.

## §7. Appendix — Minimal Capability Probe (Spec)

Report: aggregate error rates + failure taxonomy; no grand claims.
