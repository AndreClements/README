### ðŸ“‹ Current Tasks / To-Do

- **[ ] Commit Philosophical Subroutines:**
    - This is the **next immediate action**.
    - Create and populate the four files in the `/docs` directory: `PHILOSOPHY_BODY.md`, `PHILOSOPHY_PAIN.md`, `PHILOSOPHY_AESTHETICS.md`, and `PHILOSOPHY_LOVE.md`.
    - Commit them with a message like: `feat: Add core philosophical subroutines`.

- **[ ] Archive and Contextualize CI Methodology:**
    - Create a new file: `/docs/METHODOLOGY_CI.md`.
    - Archive the text of the "Lens-mode" draft paper and include the summary explaining its context in this project.

### ðŸš€ Future Goals / Backlog

- **[ ] Finalize Consent Protocol:**
    - Follow up with `Elli` for final confirmation.
    - Update `Â§5. The Network` in `README.md` to remove the "(provisional)" note upon confirmation.

- **[ ] Ongoing Dependency Validation:**
    - Cross-reference citations in `DEPENDENCIES.md` against physical library artifacts to ensure data integrity over time.

- **[ ] Develop Interactive HTML Version:**
    - Translate the static markdown into a dynamic, interactive web experience.

- **[ ] Expand License File:**
    - Expand on the custom license in `LICENSE.md`, perhaps detailing the philosophy of "ethical forking" and the relational responsibilities of merging or adapting the work.
