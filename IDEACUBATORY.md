# IDEACUBATORY
*Last Updated: 2025-07-29*

A living chamber for incubating ideas in raw, aphoristic, poetic, or speculative form. This is the system's primary "sketchbook" — a low-friction, high-chaos environment for the `Analyst` to play.

This document is the input. The structured `/docs/ideacubatory/` directory is the eventual output.

---
## Potential implementation and or deployment
- "Conditional Existentials: Aphorisms for Machines and Their Keepers."

---

## Aphoristic Fragments

- You can't have any more recursion until you finish your recursion.
- A plain sentence may hide a dead metaphor.
- Clarity is often a defense by obfuscation.
- Analytic rigour can be a kind of epistemic DRM.

---

## Notes-to-future-self

- Minimalism isn’t lack — it’s spatial respect.
- The `README.md` is the hearth; the praxis is the flame.

---

## Possible Threads to Follow

- Syntax as ceremony.
- The "empty turn" as a social protocol.
