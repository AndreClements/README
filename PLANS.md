# PLANS (v1.0)

## Project Architecture & Strategic Roadmap

**Lead Maintainer's Note:** This document outlines the high-level architectural strategy and future goals for the `README` repository. It is a living document that describes the intended evolution of the project. For a list of immediate, tactical tasks, see `TODOS.md`.

---

### **Phase 1: Genesis & Initial Deployment (Complete)**

- **Objective:** Establish the core `README.md` artifact and its foundational dependencies.
- **Status:** `v1.0.0` has been publicly released.
- **Key Artifacts:** `README.md` (v0.7.0+), `DEPENDENCIES.md` (v2.0+).

### **Phase 2: Modular Expansion (Current Phase)**

- **Objective:** To build out the rich, modular ecosystem of the praxis, transforming the repository from a single artifact into a comprehensive library.
- **Architectural Strategy:** The `/docs` directory will be structured as the primary library, with semantically named subdirectories.
    ```
    docs/
    ├── philosophies/   # Contains the core ethical and aesthetic principles.
    ├── methods/        # Contains reusable methodologies (Traits/Mixins).
    └── concepts/       # Contains definitions of key conceptual tools.
    ```
- **Current Goal:** To populate this library with the foundational modules that have been generated through the initial development process.

### **Phase 3: Network & Interface Refinement (Ongoing)**

- **Objective:** To continuously refine the system's relationship with its internal and external networks based on real-world feedback.
- **Key Processes:**
    - **Consent Protocol:** Ongoing verification of consent with all human `Observers`. The `README.md` will be updated as confirmations are received.
    - **Interface Development:** Exploration of an interactive HTML version of the `README.md` to create a more engaging public interface.

### **Phase 4: Archival & Historical Integrity (Ongoing)**

- **Objective:** To ensure the repository functions as a complete and honest "forensic aesthetic" of its own becoming.
- **Key Processes:**
    - **Expressive Git History:** Commits will continue to be written as deliberate, meaningful narrative acts.
    - **Archiving of Context:** Key artifacts that informed the project (e.g., the "Lens-mode" paper, critical dialogues) will be documented and archived in the `/docs` directory.
    - **Dependency Validation:** The `DEPENDENCIES.md` will be periodically reviewed and corrected against physical sources to ensure data integrity.
